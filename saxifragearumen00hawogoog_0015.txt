κ should say, he hnew off hsnd, and thoroughly, all

the words of the English dictionary. Huppily, it

ther all the Genera, or dolf the Dictionery; so
long es the former are systematioolly distributed,

the alphebet. .

With respect to the collocetion oi the Genera.
end Species in the present Esssy, the author does
not datter himself that it is the best thot oen be
offered for the elucidation of the Satyrag'e'ou

propose it os an improvement only, of the old oue. ·

.Perhaps, indeed, it is scarcely possible that any 'de- ·

· seriptive arrangement on perper, that is ot the same “
, time necessarilye continuous one, that is, in a
straight line, can ever be entirely unexeeptioneble.
Because every good Botanist rney perceive thot
sporiectly natural distribution oi the genero or the
speeies, should be mede„not continuously, butas
it vvere circuitously, somewhst resembling the fere
oi arnsp ; suoh being the way of nonne invariebly,
iu'arranging her manifold productione.. For as
well might ¹Geogruphers endeavour to link lting-

doms and counties longitudinally, ss a Botanist to ν

plaee genera aud speeies naturally, in the conti·
nuous wey ol 'e' straight tiss. For theKingdorns
