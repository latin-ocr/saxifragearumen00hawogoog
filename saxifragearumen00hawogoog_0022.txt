PREFAGE·

solitits the reader’s indulgence, having still endea-
voured to do his best· The strictest attention is
⁸ necessary both to the rosaceous and stoloniferous
„periods of growth in these plante, as laid downat
large ιιι the Dissertatiorz of 18033 nor can any
thing decisive he determinsd without rt, although
the period of their earliest honering seems to af·
ford the hest opportunityfo r constructing charac-
teristic nenses3 lor perhaps at no other reason are
so rnany and such strong characters simultaneously

developed. The'n are the old rosaceous leaves pi ⁴

autumn and winter, still surrouudihg the base οι .
the scape3 and the nascent stolones of spring, be-
ginning to ehoot forth3 and perhaps also, every
other character rs theu partly perceptibla3 except,
indeed, the elongation οι the stylos and elignies,
and capsulas which aee yet nnsorrned. Bur fortu-
nately the three last points are ruore of generical
than specius importante. And were we to wait
till they were formed, the rosaceous leaves would
partly disappear, and the ripening stolones would
thicken at their ends, cornnrencing the preparation
for the future rosc-sheped tulta: thus blending
tpgether the distinctiva features of two. remarkable
” reasons of growth, so as to defythe discrimination
of the most discerning eye, and bafflc the decision
οι the ntoet consummate judge. ’

Here, perhaps, towards the close of this prelace,
a few words-respecting the cultivation of Serri ro·
g'coe may neither he unacceptahle, nor inappro·
priatc3 especially as they are offered as the result
