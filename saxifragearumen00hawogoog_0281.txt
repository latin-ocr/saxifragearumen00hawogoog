Ona The beantilnlly fringed imbricating leaves of
these Crassnlae have been aptly compared by a
lady, to a Lobster's tait, which indeed they re·
sembleconsiderably. Thelringesareneatobjeets
through a pocket lens, and almost each bair
appears to arise from asinali bulbous base, arrd
· to be aecompanied with a glandular pellueld
dot ot· a different nature, within the very margin
ol tlte leaf, as in the Genera above called Ka·
losantlres 'arrd Carlogyne: but the eilia in the
former genus are very different to a botanic
eye3 being merely beautiful crystalline globes,
ortalogous to the small bulbons bases abore
mentioned, but far more crystalline: in ,the
, ’ latter genus they are renilorm: and by those
ahapes alone we can (without flowers) aalely
refer any new species to their proper placer,
which otherwise in leaf, are extremely similar.
The Cnossnrn: Ciliolce may perhaps them·
¹ selves be a Genus, bnt l have not recently been
' able to examine their flowera. They have not
„ the long tube ol Knloronllrm, and in habit they
differ from Crerlogprm5 bnt l lntow not tbe
shnpes of their germs and styles.
